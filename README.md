## Housing Price Prediction Project
Overview
This machine learning project focuses on predicting housing prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset comprises 306 features, offering a comprehensive view of housing attributes. The primary goal is to create a robust model for accurately forecasting SalePrice.

Steps to Replicate
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted thorough EDA to understand data patterns.
Explored both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values through imputation strategies.
Applied feature engineering to enhance model performance.
3. Model Selection
Employed the popular XGBoost regression model for its robustness.
Split the dataset into training and test sets for model evaluation.
4. Model Training
Utilized the training set to fit the XGBoost model.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
5. Model Evaluation
Tested the model on the test set to assess generalization.
Calculated Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for accuracy measurement.
6. Results
Achieved an RMSE of 107,632, indicating a reasonably accurate prediction.
The model can serve as a foundation for further refinement and applications.
